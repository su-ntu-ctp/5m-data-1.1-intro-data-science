Launch DBeaver and Create a New Connection:
Open DBeaver.
Click the "New Database Connection" button, or navigate to Database > New Database Connection in the menu bar.
Select DuckDB:
In the "Connect to a database" wizard, search for "DuckDB".
Select "DuckDB" from the list and click "Next".
Specify Database File Path:
In the "Connection Settings" window, locate the "Path" field.
Enter the full path to your DuckDB database file (e.g., C:\Users\YourUser\Documents\my_database.duckdb) or click the "Browse" button to navigate to and select the file.
Test and Finish Connection:
Optionally, click "Test Connection" to verify the connection.
Click "Finish" to create the connection.
Connect to the Database:
In the "Database Navigator" panel (usually on the left), locate your newly created DuckDB connection.
Double-click the connection to establish a connection to the database. A green tick icon will appear next to the connection name, indicating a successful connection.
You can now expand the connection in the Database Navigator to browse schemas, tables, and views within your DuckDB database and execute SQL queries.
